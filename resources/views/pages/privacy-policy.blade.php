                            <p>
                                The security of your personal information depends on your protection of your account password. Please do not disclose your account password to unauthorized people. <br>

                                We limit access to your personal information only to our Team which we believe need to come into contact with that information in order to do their jobs in connection with the Panaqia service.  <br>

                                You also have the right in certain circumstances to restrict the data that is being processed. You may ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information if you think it is inaccurate, you object to the processing, or you wish us to retain the information past the point at which we would normally remove it as you wish to establish or defend a legal claim. <br>
                                
                                Please contact us with your request on <a class = "blue-text" href = "mailto:wecare@panaqia.com">wecare@panaqia.com</a>.

                            </p>

                            <p><strong>7. Data portability</strong></p>

                            <p>
                                You may request a copy of the data that we hold about you in a machine-readable format (for example an Excel spreadsheet or text file) for the purposes or re-using that data for any reason. <br>

                                Please contact us with your request on <a class = "blue-text" href = "mailto:wecare@panaqia.com">wecare@panaqia.com</a>. <br>
                                
                                We will provide this free of charge within one month of the request, unless the request is complex, or we have too many requests to deal with, in which case we will inform you within one month that we will be using the extension of time we are allowed under such circumstances.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>8. Objection</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                You have the right under certain circumstances to object to the data that is either held about you or is incorrect. Should you object to our handling of your data in the areas of direct marketing, processing orders, or for any other reason, then you may inform us of your objection by emailing us on <a class = "blue-text" href = "mailto:wecare@panaqia.com">wecare@panaqia.com</a>  or write to us at the address above to let us know. <br>

                                If we agree with your written objection, and whilst we consider it, that we will not use the data in the way to which you are objecting, then we will restrict the processing of that data free of charge and within one month, unless the request is complex, or we have too many requests to deal with. In which case, we will inform you within one month that we may need an extension of time. <br>
                                
                                You will also be given the option to object to us sending you marketing information at the point at which you place an order with us or give us your personal information, and this is addressed in point number 1. ‘Your right to be informed’.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>9. Automated decision making and profiling</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                We may make automated decisions (via a computer algorithm) on certain aspects of the marketing materials that we send to you. We do not make any other automated decisions on your information. <br>

                                We do not make any decisions based on ethnicity, race, sex, gender or disability. <br>

                                If you object to the automated data processing that we perform on your personal information, then you may ask us not to do this. Since this decision making is integral to how we send marketing materials, then we will simply remove any marketing consent that you have given to us, which will result in your data not being processed in this way. <br>

                                Please contact us with your request on <a class = "blue-text" href = "mailto:wecare@panaqia.com">wecare@panaqia.com</a>  or write to us at the address above to let us know. <br>
                                
                                We will do this free of charge within one month, unless the request is complex, or we have too many requests to deal with, in which case we will inform you within one month that we may need an extension of time.
                            </p>
