## About The Project





### [Live Demo - Heroku](https://panaqia.herokuapp.com/)
N/B: The image upload feature does not work in the demo link because Heroku does not have the GD & exif libraries necessary for image upload and processing

## Built With

* PHP
* Laravel
* MySQL Server (any supported RDBMS can be used)

## Prerequisites

- PHP 7.1 or later (best if also added to the env path `$PATH` for easy access while using the terminal)
- MySQL Server, PsotgreSQL, or any other RDBMS supported by Laravel
- Composer
- Text Editor - Visual Studio Code recommended
- MPESA Daraja API credentials (https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/)

## Getting Started

* Clone this repo
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/dismuskiplimo/panaqia.git
    ```

* Navigate to panaqia folder/directory

    ```shell
    cd panaqia
    ```
* Rename `.env.example` to become `.env`
    ```shell
    mv .env.example .env
    ```
* Open the `.env` file using your favourite text editor. This file contains necessary configuration data for the application to run
* You need only to edit the `DB` section e.g `DB_DATABASE`,`DB_USERNAME`,`DB_PASSWORD`, for the initial installation. Ensure that the database selected is already created in your REBMS server (mysql, postgresql, sqlite e.t.c) or the installation will fail.

## Installation

After the `.env` configuration file has been updated, resume to the terminal and type in the following commands

1. Install all the dependencies.
   ```shell
    composer install
   ```
2. Generate the application keys
    ```shell
    php artisan key:generate
    ```
3. Create the tables and migrate them to your DB
    ```shell
    php artisan migrate
    ```
4. Populate the database with necessary system configuration
    ```shell
    php artisan db:seed`
    ```
    Yaay, you're done üëç
    
5. Now, Launch the development server.
   ```shell
   php artisan serve
   ```
6. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view the website
7. Once you verify that the website is working, re-open the `.env` file to finish defining the remaining configurations
